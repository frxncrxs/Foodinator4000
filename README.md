# Foodinator4000
2019 Cutie Hack submission

The Foodinator 4000 is an Arduino based machine that through motion detection input and a timer releases food via a servo mechanism.

Inspiration
To prevent our four legged friends and bipedal roommates from over indulging themselves.

Function:
Sends rf signal to and from the transcievers regarding that if their is or isn't a person or four legged friend in front of the bowl. Then the user can control out flow of food to the pet or room mate at the moment.

Materials:
(3) Arduino Unos (2) NRF24 Radio Transceivers (4) LEDs (3) Breadboards (1) DS1307 RTC real time clock (7) cardboard (2) sticks (1) roll of black tape (1) seven segment display (1) PIR sensor (2) servos (1) battery pack (#) Various Resistors

Construction Challenges:
Linking clock with the LED light Also linkage of radio transmitters and receivers with the Servo motors Trying to balance stick on top of the box figuring out right measurements for stand up box how to code transmitters and receivers configuration angles of Servo motor movement aka getting Servo motors move the way we wanted to

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Integration of clock and LED light by force Making clock work adding servo motors to lid, giving it mobility

What We Learned:
how to make clock how to code a program and send commands to hardware how to make light work through analog analog pins can be very finnicky servos require tinkering to get correct coding in arduino researching proper libraries to implement radio frequency devices integrated systems

What's next for Foodinator 4000
Foodinator 5000 now with INTERNET & integration of clock mechanism
